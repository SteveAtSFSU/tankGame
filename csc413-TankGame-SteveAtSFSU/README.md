About the game:
at first we tried creating parent classes for background, wall, tank, and bullets. Really we forget to just go with moveable and notmoveable object abstract classes. We did not really plan
out the process which is why I feel we felt short of expectations even though I know we could easily make a better game. Also the game really runs just with tankGame.java, gameEnvironment.java,
tankObject.java, tankObject2.java, and gameObject.java . All extra classes are our attempts to create classes for each object. We did not implement the observer/observable pattern which I feel 
would have definitely made it easier to keep track of the moveable objects. I left a lot of code commented out because that was our misfires in coding and trying to implement code. 
But yeah most definitely going to put a lot of work in the last game. I feel like we will do really well having dealt with this sphagetti mess coding. 

Notes:
tanks move independently.
tank on the left controls are w,s,a,d.  space bar to fire.  when tank on left is destroyed press 1 to respawn.
tank on the right controls are the arrows. enter to fire.  when tank on the right is destroyed press 2 to respawn.
fixed image drawing to look smoother. 
tanks cannot go out of bounds.
 
Second go about the game 8/07/2017 - 8/09/2017:
After disbanding the original group with my partner due to productivity issues, I quickly went to work on the tank game I had try to create in the first place.
Within 48 hours, in a span of about 18 hours, I completed a bare bones tank game. I will add power ups, more destructable wall patterns, and movement updates before sunday 8/13/2017.
Overall even though I did not gain the experience of working with a functional group, I furthered my confidence in coding the largest project I have made from scratch with limited time (even though that's my fault).

8/12/2017 cloned repo onto my home computer. going to addd final touches on game later today. 

8/12/2017
tank game now has game music and sounds. Tanks make a loud explosion noise when destroyed, and walls make a lesser noise.
